\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Introduction}
The Typing Speed Tester is a project that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. It takes a paragraph as input and calculates the user's typing speed in terms of letters per minute (LPM) and their accuracy. The project provides a user-friendly interface and displays the results in an easy-to-understand format.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The Typing Speed Tester project is a useful tool for individuals who want to improve their typing skills. It provides an interactive and engaging way to test typing speed and accuracy. By using random paragraphs and calculating various metrics, the project offers valuable insights into the user's typing performance. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced typist, the Typing Speed Tester can help you track your progress and enhance your typing abilities.

% \subsection{Future Works and Direction}
% For future development and expansion of a typing speed test implemented in C++, here are specific areas and improvements you might consider:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\textbf{User Customization:}}
%  Allow users to select typing exercises of varying difficulty levels, themes, or specific texts. Enable customization of test duration, text size, and the inclusion of special characters or symbols.

%   \item {\textbf{Accessibility Features:}}
%    Ensure the typing test is accessible to all users by incorporating features like screen reader compatibility, high-contrast modes, keyboard navigation, and adjustable font sizes.
 
% \end{itemize}
% By focusing on these areas, you can not only enhance the typing speed test's functionality but also improve its usability, engagement, and effectiveness as a tool for improving typing skills in the C++ environment.
