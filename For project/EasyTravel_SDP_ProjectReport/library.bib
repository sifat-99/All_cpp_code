Moreover the human judgment cannot be relied upon. A system is formulated which takes into account various available performance data of players and gives an optimized and balanced team, with right number of batsmen, bowler, and wicketkeeper without any human interference, which is limited to entering performance data only.},

abstract = {Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world with a fan base of approximately 2.5 billion people. Selecting a Cricket team for a match is a challenging task further complicated by the relatively large number of aspirants. Each player on a cricket team fulfils a particular role based on their skill sets and having a balanced subset of these skill sets on a team can have a significant impact on the team's performance. The determination of the team's composition is therefore an integral part of automating the process of team selection. This research intends to build on the use of Genetic Algorithms to automate team selection by introducing a method which enlists the aid of Data Mining.},

Winning in Cricket depends on various aspects like weather, track records of the performances of players, performances at a specific venue, match experiences, performance against a specific team and the current form of the team and the player. In this paper the main goal is to estimate a win prediction for ODI (One Day International) cricket match. For purposes of model building, various method has been applied retrospectively to the data that are already obtained from previously played matches. From them, Random Forest has given the best outcome of 92.6{\%}.},

abstract = {Selection of players for a sports team within a finite budget is a complex task which can be viewed as a constrained multi-objective optimization and a multiple criteria decision making problem. The task is specially challenging for the game of cricket where a team requires players who are efficient in multiple roles. In the formation of a good and successful cricket team, batting strength and bowling strength of a team are major factors affecting its performance and an optimum trade-off needs to be reached. We propose a novel gene representation scheme and a multi-objective approach using the NSGA-II algorithm to optimize the overall batting and bowling strength of a team with 11 players as variables. Fielding performance and a number of other cricketing criteria are also used in the optimization and decision-making process. Using the information from the trade-off front obtained, a multi-criteria decision making approach is then proposed for the final selection of team. Case studies using a set of players auctioned in Indian Premier League (IPL) 4th edition are illustrated and players' current statistical data is used to define performance indicators. The proposed computational techniques are ready to be extended according to individualistic preferences of different franchises and league managers in order to form a preferred team within the budget constraints. It is also shown how such an analysis can help in dynamic auction environments, like selecting a team under player-by-player auction. The methodology is generic and can be easily extended to other sports like American football, baseball and other league games.},

The model has three components which are based on multifarious considerations emerging out of a deeper analysis of T20 cricket. The models are created using Data Analytics methods from machine learning domain. The prediction accuracy obtained is high as the Mayo Predictor Model is able to correctly predict the outcomes of 39 matches out of the 56 matches played in the league stage of the IPL IX tournament. Further improvement in the model can be attempted by using a larger training data set than the one that has been utilized in this work. No such effort at creating predictor models for cricket matches has been reported in the literature.},

Since a cricket team needs to be more flexible, balanced and diverse, we defined fitness function to check the optimality of the team, and how the optimality changes with the change in gene composition of a chromosome. The proposed method takes into account several important factors that affect a team combination like: No. of pacers and spinners, composition of left hander and right hander, partnership records etc. Starting from a random initial population, the normal SGA operations (selection, reproduction and mutation) to get the next population set and the process is iterated till an optimal team is produced or a fixed number of times. The proposed system is made very generic and it can be applied for any game by just modifying the fitness function. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract = {There are mainly three renowned formats of cricket – ODI (One Day International), Test Match and T20 (Twenty Twenty). Selecting a 15 men perfect squad for a particular cricket match in a particular cricket tournament isn't an easy task. Coach and captain play a vital role to select the most perfect players for a match to win by keeping many parameters in their head such as – analyzing the past scored runs comparing with the balls faced, strike rate, total 50's , total 100's, whether the player is right handed or left handed, against which team she/ he has scored well enough (for batsman). Analyzing the past conceded runs comparing with the overs she/ he had taken, economy rate, strike rate, wickets, against which team she/ he has performed well, pitch condition, venue etc. In this paper, we have taken maximum number of parameters in consideration for selecting 1 captain (for captaincy issue), 6 batsmen (top-order, middle-order and finisher), 2 all-rounders, 1 wicket keeper and 5 bowlers (fast bowlers, spinners). Our model can be extended for the team selection in other formats of cricket too. We have used k-means clustering, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes and Page Rank algorithms for selecting batsmen and all-rounders. Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Decision Tree and RankSVM have been used for selecting bowlers. We have used Bar Graph to show the statistics of different parameters for both captain and wicket-keeper. Our motive is to recommend 15 men squad for a cricket team to the selectors.},

abstract = {Precedence of cricket teams depicts the authority of teams over the counter peers. The existing ad-hoc ranking systems either incorporate the count of won or lost matches, or just consider the winning margins. The batting and bowling productivity at team level along with the reward for each win and penalty against each lost never adopted for extracting the supremacy of teams over the others. The intuition of this paper is to address the aforementioned limitations while presenting an effective mechanism. With this aim, first of all, effective features are explicitly formulated for finding batting and bowling productivity precedence. Subsequently, these features are combined to devise the team productivity metric. Moreover, an efficient productivity precedence algorithm is presented that incorporates the defined features to retrieve the batting, bowling and team precedences in one day international matches. Extensive experiments are performed for this purpose, the results of which show that the presented method renders quite promising insights. Further, the batting, bowling and team evolution is also presented to depict the precedences of different spans. The presented method can be explicitly adopted for cricket team rankings.},

The Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament organized every year by the Board of Cricket Control of India has become very popular with a huge fan following. It is based on franchises bidding for acquiring players to play for their side. Huge amounts of money are involved in the auction. Ranking of players in IPL according to their performance is an important step that would allow franchises and team managers to take better informed decisions in choosing their sides. In this paper, a machine learning based approach is used to create a new index, named as Deep Performance Index (DPI), that reflects the performance of the batsmen and bowlers on a deeper analysis of the requirements of T20 cricket. The Recursive Feature elimination algorithm based on machine learning is used for extracting meaningful features and their relative importance towards designing the DPI. It is shown that DPI is able to better capture performance related data for both batsmen and bowlers when compared to some other well-known ranking schemes for T20 cricket.},

abstract = {Victory is the ultimate goal in any sport. In this work we address the winning factors in the sport of One Day International (ODI) cricket. Winning an ODI cricket match depends on various factors related to scoring as well as physical strength of the two teams. Some of the factors have been described in the literature but there is scope for further research on analyzing them, especially with reference to predicting victory. Interesting factors include home game advantage, day / night effect, winning the toss and batting first. In this article, we have used artificial intelligence techniques, more specifically Bayesian classifiers in machine learning, to predict how these factors affect the outcome of an ODI cricket match. Based on the emerged results, we have developed a software tool called CricAI. This tool outputs the probability of victory in an ODI cricket match using input factors such as home game advantage available at the beginning of the match. The CricAI tool can be used in real-world applications by teams playing cricket. It can accordingly be helpful in adjusting certain factors in order to maximize the chances of winning the real game. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

We explore the use of neural networks to rate players and select specific players for a competition. We take cricket as an example. Cricket is a game with mass following in British Commonwealth Countries as well as some other countries. National teams visit other countries for bilateral matches as well as play in World Cup tournaments. We employ neural networks to predict each cricketer's performance in the future based upon their past performance. We classify cricketers into three categories - performer, moderate and failure. We collected data on cumulative player performance from 1985 onwards until the 2006-2007 season. The neural network models were progressively trained and tested using four sets of data. The trained neural network models were then applied to generate a forecast of the cricketer's near term performance. Based on the ratings generated and by applying heuristic rules we recommend cricketers to be included in the World Cup 2007. We evaluate the actual performance of the cricketers in the World Cup to validate the applicability of neural networks. The results show that the neural networks can indeed provide valuable decision support in a team selection process. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We critically examine a number of flaws in the design of the knockout bracket that was used by UEFA: group advantage, lack of win incentive, and arbitrary choices. We suggest two fairer procedures that satisfy the balance and group diversity constraints but eliminate group advantage and significantly increase win incentive, hence interest in the group stage. The suggested procedures use a global ranking of the 16 teams qualified to the knockout stage based on their performance during the group stage. They apply to any tournament consisting of a round robin stage made of 6 groups of 4, followed by a knockout stage. UEFA has decided to keep the 2016 format for Euro 2020, but has used our work to modify the knockout bracket so as to minimize group advantage.},

abstract = {Social media has become a platform of first choice where one can express his/her feelings with freedom. The sports and matches being played are also discussed on social media such as Twitter. In this article, efforts are made to investigate the feasibility of using collective knowledge obtained from microposts posted on Twitter to predict the winner of a Cricket match. For predictions, we use three different methods that depend on the total number of tweets before the game for each team, fans sentiments toward each team and fans score predictions on Twitter. By combining these three methods, we classify winning team prediction in a Cricket game before the start of game. Our results are promising enough to be used for winning team forecast. Furthermore, the effectiveness of supervised learning algorithms is evaluated where Support Vector Machine (SVM) has shown advantage over other classifiers.},

abstract = {Selection of players for a high performance cricket team within a finite budget is a complex task which can be viewed as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. In cricket team formation, batting strength and bowling strength of a team are the major factors affecting its performance and an optimum trade-off needs to be reached in formation of a good team. We propose a multi-objective approach using NSGA-II algorithm to optimize overall batting and bowling strength of a team and find team members in it. Using the information from trade-off front, a decision making approach is also proposed for final selection of team. Case study using a set of players auctioned in Indian Premier League, 4th edition has been taken and player's current T-20 statistical data is used as performance parameter. This technique can be used by franchise owners and league managers to form a good team within budget constraints given by the organizers. The methodology is generic and can be easily extended to other sports like soccer, baseball etc. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Player selection is one the most important tasks for any sport and cricket is no exception. The performance of the players depends on various factors such as the opposition team, the venue, his current form etc. The team management, the coach and the captain select 11 players for each match from a squad of 15 to 20 players. They analyze different characteristics and the statistics of the players to select the best playing 11 for each match. Each batsman contributes by scoring maximum runs possible and each bowler contributes by taking maximum wickets and conceding minimum runs. This paper attempts to predict the performance of players as how many runs will each batsman score and how many wickets will each bowler take for both the teams. Both the problems are targeted as classification problems where number of runs and number of wickets are classified in different ranges. We used na$\backslash$"ive bayes, random forest, multiclass SVM and decision tree classifiers to generate the prediction models for both the problems. Random Forest classifier was found to be the most accurate for both the problems.},

abstract = {The success or failure of any team lies in the skills and abilities of the players that comprise the team. The process of player selection and team formation in multi-player sports is a complex multi-criteria problem where the ultimate success is determined by how the collection of individual players forms an effective team. In general, the selection of soccer players and formation of a team are judgments made by the coaches on the basis of the best available information. Very few structured and analytical models have been developed to support coaches in this effort. We propose a two-phase framework for player selection and team formation in soccer. The first phase evaluates the alternative players with a fuzzy ranking method and selects the top performers for inclusion in the team. The second phase evaluates the alternative combinations of the selected players with a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and selects the best combinations for team formation. A case study is used to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.},

To make this process simpler and easy for the selection committee, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Model is developed that considers various parameters of a player. Using the player parameters, he/she is clustered and rated by the use of Fuzzy rules into different categories as per his/her performance throughout the career. The player data along with their rating are sent into an Android application that does the task of team selection. This would ease out the work of the selection committee.},
